# ExceptionsInJava
This repository holds examples of introductory exception handling in Java

## AverageOfIntegers.java
- This class reads user input as a String
- Converts that string to an Integer
- Uses a Try and Catch to see if an exception is thrown based on input provided

## UniqueTitleChecker.java
- This class reads in data from a file "bookTitles.inp"
- It reads through that data and adds to it a HashSet
- The HashSet maintains unique values so duplicates not added
- The unique information is then outputted to a newly created file
- using IOException and FileNotFoundException to check for values
